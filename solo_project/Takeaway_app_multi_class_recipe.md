# Takeaway App - Multi-Class Planned Design Recipe

## 1. Describe the Problem

As a customer
So that I can check if I want to order something
I would like to see a list of dishes with prices.

As a customer
So that I can order the meal I want
I would like to be able to select some number of several available dishes.

As a customer
So that I can verify that my order is correct
I would like to see an itemised receipt with a grand total.

As a customer
So that I am reassured that my order will be delivered on time
I would like to receive a text such as "Thank you! Your order was placed and will be delivered before 18:52" after I have ordered.

## 2. Design the Class System

_Diagram of the classes and their relationships using

```
 +--------------------+    +-------------------+
 |  Menu              |    | Order             |
 |                    |    |                   |
 |  -add(dish)        |    | -add(dish)        |
 |  -display_menu     |    | -receipt          |
 |                    |    |                   |
 +------------------+-+    +--+----------------+
                    |         |
owns a full list of |         | owns a partial list of
                    |         |
                    v         v
              +-------------------+
              | Dish(name,price)  |
              |                   |
              | -name             |
              | -price            |
              |                   |
              +-------------------+


```

_The interface of each class in more detail:_

```ruby
class Dish
  def initialize(name, price)
  end

  def name
    # returns the name of the dish
  end

  def price
    # returns the price of the dish
  end
end

class Menu
  def initialize
    # creates a menu list array where index will be used as an item_number
  end

  def add(dish) #dish is an instance of Dish
    # adds a dish to the menu list
    # returns nothing
  end

  def display_menu
    # returns the menu list of dishes with name and price
  end

  def menu_item(item_number)
    # returns the instance of Dish corresponding to the index(item_number) in the menu list
  end

end

class Order
  def initialize
    # creates an order list
  end

  def add(menu_item) #menu_item is the instance of Dish thats returned from Menu class menu_item method
    # adds a dish to the order list
    # returns nothing
  end

  def receipt
    # returns a string with contents of the order list and a grand total cost
  end

  def complete
    # returns a final receipt
    # sends a text confirming the order and providing a delivery time
end
```

## 3. Create Examples as Integration Tests

_Examples of the classes being used together in different situations and
combinations that reflect the ways in which the system will be used:_

```ruby
# EXAMPLE

# Gets all tracks
library = MusicLibrary.new
track_1 = Track.new("Carte Blanche", "Veracocha")
track_2 = Track.new("Synaesthesia", "The Thrillseekers")
library.add(track_1)
library.add(track_2)
library.all # => [track_1, track_2]

# 


```

## 4. Create Examples as Unit Tests

_Create examples, where appropriate, of the behaviour of each relevant class at
a more granular level of detail._

```ruby
# EXAMPLE

# Constructs a track
track = Track.new("Carte Blanche", "Veracocha")
track.title # => "Carte Blanche"


# constructs a dish
dish = Dish.new("Pad Thai",7.99)
dish.name # => "Pad Thai"
dish.price # => 7.99

# displays empty menu list when no dishes are added
menu = Menu.new
menu.display_menu # => ""

# returns an error if asked to retrieve a menu item when no dishes have been added
menu = Menu.new
menu.menu_item(1) # => error message: "No dishes have been added to the menu"

# gives an empty receipt if no menu items have been added to an order
order = Order.new
order.receipt # => "grand total: Â£0.00"


```

_Encode each example as a test. You can add to the above list as you go._

## 5. Implement the Behaviour

_After each test you write, follow the test-driving process of red, green,
refactor to implement the behaviour._
